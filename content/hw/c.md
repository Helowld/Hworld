```c
// The #include is a preprocessor command that tells the compiler to include the contents of stdio.h (standard input and output) file in the program
#include <stdio.h>
// The execution of a C program starts from the main() function
int main() { 
   
   // printf() displays the string inside quotation
   printf("Hello, World!"); 

   // The return 0; statement is the "Exit status" of the program. In simple terms, the program ends with this statement
   return 0;
}
```

### About language
C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.
